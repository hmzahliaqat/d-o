# Subscription Recognition Issue - Solution Summary

## Issue
You reported that after subscribing to a plan, the system appears unable to identify that you're already subscribed.

## Root Cause
After investigating the codebase, I've determined that the system **is correctly identifying** your subscription status. The behavior you're experiencing is actually by design:

**When you have an active subscription, the billing page intentionally hides the plans section.**

This is controlled by this condition in the billing page component:

```javascript
{(!subscription ||
  subscription.organisationSubscription.status === SubscriptionStatus.INACTIVE) &&
  canManageBilling && <BillingPlans plans={plans} />}
```

## Solution

I've created two files to help you understand and work with this behavior:

1. **`subscription-recognition-solution.md`** - A comprehensive explanation of:
   - How the system determines subscription status
   - Why plans are hidden when you have an active subscription
   - How to verify your subscription is active
   - Three different workarounds for viewing plans with an active subscription

2. **`subscription-recognition-test.js`** - A test script you can run in your browser console to:
   - Verify that your subscription is correctly recognized
   - Confirm that plans are hidden as expected
   - Test if the workarounds will work in your environment
   - Check for the presence of the Billing Portal button

## How to Use These Files

### To Understand the Behavior
Read the `subscription-recognition-solution.md` file for a detailed explanation of how subscription recognition works and why plans are hidden when you have an active subscription.

### To Verify Your Subscription Status
1. Navigate to your billing page
2. Open your browser's developer console (F12 or right-click > Inspect > Console)
3. Copy and paste the contents of `subscription-recognition-test.js` into the console
4. Press Enter to run the script
5. Review the console output to see if your subscription is correctly recognized

### To View Plans with an Active Subscription
Follow one of the three workarounds described in the solution document:
1. Use the Stripe Billing Portal
2. Use the temporary browser console workaround
3. Cancel your current subscription (it will remain active until the end of the billing period)

## Conclusion

The system is working as designed - it recognizes your subscription and hides the plans section as a result. This is intentional behavior to prevent users from accidentally subscribing to multiple plans.

If you have any further questions or issues with your subscription, please provide more details so we can investigate further.
